# obvWatchBot
Summary:


This bot retrieves OBV index data using API! Bot for Discord

*Currently only builds links*


Software:


-Made using repl.it

-Written in Python

-API alphavantage

-Monitoring Service UptimeRobot


Notes/Bugs/Future Updates:

- Still very new to Python and bot building.

- Bot only builds links that takes you to data

- Need a better API. Data is old, Json doesnt work very well, and the APIs documentation is lacking.

- Eventually would like this bot to scan and trigger when obv swings in a certain range (momentum shift)

- I want this bot to also work for crypto and track momentum swings.

- Still in very early development and I am a student programmer that only does this in spare time

Have fun and share!
